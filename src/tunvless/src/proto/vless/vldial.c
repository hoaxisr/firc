 *   status: 1 New, 2 Keep, 3 End, 4 KeepAlive. Options: bit 0 has data, bit 1 error.
 * The first datagram of a flow is New: after the options come the network (2 = UDP), port,
 * address type and destination address, then the GlobalID (8 bytes; by it an Xray server
 * returns the same UDP socket for a new stream, "full cone"). Then Keep without an address: the
 * destination does not change, and for Keep without an address the server uses New's
 * destination (sing-box: metadata length 4, no address). One flow, one destination, as with
