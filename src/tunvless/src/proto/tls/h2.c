/* A minimal HTTP/2 client: one stream on a connection, a body both ways. The gRPC transport's;
 * xhttp runs on the multi-stream engine (h2mux.c, xconn.c).
 *
 * gRPC is HTTP/2: the server expects the preface, frames and flow control, and without them the
 * connection just hangs.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT here, and why that is fine:
 *
 *   - multiplexing. Every VLESS connection gets its own TCP+TLS (Xray instead caches one gRPC
 *     connection per node);
 *   - HPACK on receive. Response headers are not parsed; only :status is extracted: a static
 *     index, or a literal with an indexed name as digits or Huffman code (a Go server sends
 *     502, 401, 301 this way, see status_huff in h2wire.h). Full HPACK needs a dynamic table, i.e. memory
 *     per connection;
 *   - PUSH_PROMISE. Disabled in SETTINGS, so it cannot arrive;
 *   - priorities and trailers. The first decides nothing, the second only closes the stream.
 *
 * Memory: one state per VLESS connection, and a loop thread holds hundreds of connections (MAX_CONNS in stack.c), so there is no frame buffer.
 * Records are read into a per-thread buffer, and only what cannot be parsed at once carries
 * over between calls: a split frame header (9 bytes), a control frame body (64) and the count
 * of unread body. A 16 KB frame buffer per connection would add up to megabytes.
