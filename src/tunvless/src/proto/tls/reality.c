/* Reality handshake.
 *
 * Plain TLS proves the server by its certificate. Reality cannot: the certificate the server
 * sends belongs to a real third-party site, which the server proxies for anyone who does not
 * prove themselves. Checking the chain is pointless; the proof works differently:
 *
 *   1. the server has a static X25519 pair; the client knows the public half (pbk);
 *   2. the client generates an ephemeral pair and puts the public half in the ClientHello
 *      key_share, exactly where real TLS 1.3 has it;
 *   3. from its private key and pbk the client computes a shared secret and from it a short
 *      authenticator, hidden in the 32 bytes of session_id;
 *   4. the server computes the same secret with its private key and checks it. On a match it
 *      serves VLESS; otherwise it proxies to the real site.
 *
 * Two consequences shape the code below.
 *
 * The ClientHello must be INDISTINGUISHABLE from a browser's, not merely similar: the set and
 * order of extensions, the cipher list, GREASE values. Any deviation makes us an atypical
 * client, which is a signal by itself even with a valid authenticator. So the Hello is built
 * here by hand: a library TLS stack would send its own extension order.
 *
 * And failure looks like success: the server answers no error, it serves the real site, and the
 * handshake completes. Only the HMAC in the server's temporary certificate (checked by tls13.c,
 * see certverify.h) or the VLESS answer tells.
